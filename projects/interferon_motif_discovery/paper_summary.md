Schoggins, J.W. et al. (2011). A diverse range of gene products are effectors of the type I interferon antiviral response. Nature, 472, 481–485.

## Background:

Type I interferons induce hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that establish an antiviral state in cells. However, it remained unclear which of these genes directly contribute to antiviral defense.

## Research Question:

Which ISGs function as direct antiviral effectors, and how diverse are their mechanisms?

## Methods:

To systematically identify functional antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), the authors compiled a curated list of ISGs from previously published interferon-treated gene expression datasets. Each selected ISG was individually cloned into a bicistronic lentiviral expression vector that co-expressed the ISG and a fluorescent marker (TagRFP), allowing identification of successfully transduced cells.

Human cell lines were transduced with these lentiviral constructs to express one ISG at a time. The engineered cells were then infected with GFP-expressing viruses representing diverse viral families. Viral replication was quantitatively measured using flow cytometry (FACS) by assessing GFP signal specifically in TagRFP-positive cells.

By comparing infection levels between ISG-expressing cells and controls, the authors identified genes that significantly inhibited or enhanced viral replication. This large-scale functional screening enabled the classification of ISGs based on their antiviral activity across multiple viruses.

## Key Findings:

- Only a subset of ISGs exhibited strong antiviral activity.
- ISGs display diverse mechanisms and virus-specific effects.
- Interferon-induced antiviral defense is highly specialized and modular.
- ISG activation is regulated through interferon signaling pathways involving STAT transcription factors and regulatory promoter elements.

## Relevance to This Project:

This study provides a biologically validated set of ISGs. In this project, promoter regions upstream of selected ISGs will be analyzed to computationally infer shared regulatory motifs that coordinate interferon-driven gene activation.
