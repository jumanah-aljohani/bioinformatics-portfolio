# Bioinformatics Portfolio

This repository documents my learning journey and hands-on practice in bioinformatics and genomic data analysis.  
It includes both coursework-based implementations and independent data-driven projects using public biological datasets.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my progression from foundational bioinformatics concepts to applied genomic analysis, as preparation for research internships and graduate studies in genomics and computational biology.
